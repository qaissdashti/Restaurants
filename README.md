The files used are raw data of transaction of the resutant, and all its brancghes in Kuwait. The files capture the date, amount, time, branch.

<b> My Questions </b>
There is no purpose in mind when analyzing the data, the idea was to see if we can better understand the business and its characteris. Maybe find new patterns or trends that we can build on.

1. Why some branches sell more at a specifc time?
2. Does the day of the week effect orders?
3. Does the amount differ between branches and do other branches have higher order means?
